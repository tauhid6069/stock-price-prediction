# Stock Price Prediction using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)

This project applies **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**, specifically **LSTMs**, to forecast stock price trends based on historical financial data. The notebook demonstrates the complete workflow from preprocessing stock market data to training, evaluating, and visualising predictions.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
Financial markets generate highly sequential and time-dependent data. RNNs are designed to capture temporal dependencies, making them well-suited for stock price forecasting.

This project trains an **LSTM model** to predict future stock closing prices using past stock values.

---

## âœ¨ Features
- Load and preprocess historical stock price dataset  
- Normalize and window time-series data for training  
- Build and train an **LSTM model with TensorFlow/Keras**  
- Visualize predicted vs actual stock price trends  
- Evaluate performance with error metrics
